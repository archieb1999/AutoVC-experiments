# AutoVC-experiments

In this repo we run a few experiments using AutoVC architecture for voice style transfer. 
A compact for of all experiments are mainly done in experiments.ipynb notebook. There are some further details regarding the experiments in the notebook.
However, to run the experiments, the model checkpoint files need to be downloaded to the same directory as the experiments.ipynb file.
The checkpoint files (i.e. the pre-trained models provided by the authors) can be downloaded from the google drive links in this page: https://github.com/auspicious3000/autovc


#### The utterance samples generated using Elevenlabs are available in the Elevenlabs samples directory.

#### Samples generated using different downsampling-upsampling factor is available at 'Different downsampling rate files' directory.
